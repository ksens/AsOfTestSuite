# ================= TEST OF ACCURACY ====================
# Load the arrays using opaque load and verify the counts

Run:
./loadArrays.sh `pwd`/accuracy/left.array `pwd`/accuracy/right.array

count for Left array
>> 3031
count for Right array
>> 2


# The outputs generated by as.of in R and axial_aggregate/cumulate in AFL are stored at:

# Generate the output using Donghui's AsOf operator
iquery -aq "store(asof(left_array, right_array), asof_donghui)"

## Then generate the output in format required for diff by the following query:

# ================= TEST OF SPEED ====================

# First copy the large data file into local folder (not under SVN control as it is quite large)
# File is stored at salty (10.0.20.185)
cp -r /public/FinancePOC/AsOfJoinValidation/speed/*.array speed/

# Load the arrays using opaque load and verify the counts

Run:
./loadArrays.sh `pwd`/speed/left.array `pwd`/speed/right.array

count for Left array
>> 619189
count for Right array
>> 5032

# Calculate the time for using Donghui's AsOf operator
time iquery -aq "consume(asof(left_array, right_array))"

# Now calculate the time for using Alex's AsOf operator
time ./speed/asofjoin_alex.sh left_array right_array
(Note that Alex's script stores the output into another array; it is not an operator and hence difficult to consume)
